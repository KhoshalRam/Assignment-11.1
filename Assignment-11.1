DATA SET DESCRIPTION 
Column 1: District ID I4N 1M1 varchar 
Column 2: Distributor name shell varchar 
Column 3: Buy rate (million) $957.70 varchar 
Column 4: Sell rate(million) $5779.92 varchar 
Column 5: volume IN(million cubic litre) 933, int 
Column 6: volume OUT(million cubic litre) 843, int 
Column 7: Year 1624 int 


1.	What is the total amount of petrol in volume sold by every distributor? 
Code:
A = load ‘petrol.txt’ using PigStorage(‘,’)as (id:chararray,name:chararray,buy_rate:chararray,sell_rate:chararray,volume_in:int,volume_out:int,year:int);
B = foreach A generate $1,$5;
C = group B by name;
D = foreach C generate group,SUM(B.volume_out);
Dump D;

 
2.	Which are the top 10 distributors ID's for selling petrol? Also display the amount of petrol sold in volume. 

Code:
A = load ‘petrol.txt’ using PigStorage(‘,’)as (id:chararray,name:chararray,buy_rate:chararray,sell_rate:chararray,volume_in:int,volume_out:int,year:int);
B= foreach A generate $0,$5;
C = group B by Id;
D = foreach C generate group,SUM(B.volume_out);
E = order D by $1 desc;
F = limit E 10;
Dump F;




3.	List 10 years where consumption of petrol is more with the distributer id who sold it.
  Code:
A = load ‘petrol.txt’ using PigStorage(‘,’)as (id:chararray,name:chararray,buy_rate:chararray,sell_rate:chararray,volume_in:int,volume_out:int,year:int);
B = foreach A generate $0,$5,$6;
C = group B by year;
D = foreach C generate group,B.Id as id,MAX(B.volume_out) as max;
E = order D by max desc;
F = limit E 10;
Dump F;



4.	Find the distributer name who sold petrol in least amount.

Code:
A = load ‘petrol.txt’ using PigStorage(‘,’)as (id:chararray,name:chararray,buy_rate:chararray,sell_rate:chararray,volume_in:int,volume_out:int,year:int);
B= foreach A generate $1,$5;
C = group B by name;
D = foreach C generate group,SUM(B.volume_out);
E = order D by $1 ;
F = limit E 1;
Dump F;
